Okay honestly people have bad days but I have been having a bad year. After a while, humans can't stand a certain amount of stress and pressure. No one can handle things effortlessly. It just so incredibly draining to be stressed over and over for the same reason. I'm tired of people's shit. It's hard when you fall head over heels for someone and they use you and once they're tired of you, they decide to be an asshole and destroy the feeble wall of sanity you've tried to rebuild over and over again. For the past month I have been put on more than five different kinds of anti depressants. For a whole month I have been an SSRI zombie. A zombie with no emotions or all emotions all at once. I have been a zombie with dying compassion and loyalty but all I have gotten is a month of misery and disappointment. A month of suffering and a month of suicide attempts. I was finally given Adderall last weekend and I all got out of it was starving myself and not sleeping for days on end. 

What happened to all of the other people who were going through their problems too? Where are they? And where are all of the people that seemed like they loved and supported you? What did I do to diminish the list of my friends and family to a 0. Is Portland just full of the worst people in the entirety of the United States?

I'm over this life thing.
